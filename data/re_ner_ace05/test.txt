Well , if it 's true and obviously we do n't know just yet but if it 's true , it is very significant because it 's effectively the Iraqis admitting that many of the civilian casualties that we 've seen over the last few days may in fact have been caused by Iraqi surface to air missiles falling back to ground in residential areas .

The final price , $ 26.50 per share , beats all the previous bids by a huge margin -- of course , Oracle lowballed their earlier offers , and ended up basically bidding against themselves and the optimism of other Peoplesoft shareholders for a year and a half .

Southern states considering higher cigarette taxes ?



Byrne
0,0 per


2005-02-26T14 :44:00



Good plan ; cigarettes impose pretty high penalties on states , inasmuch as the states are caretakers for plenty of people who are ill thanks to cigarettes .
9,9 gpe|14,14 gpe|16,16 gpe|20,20 per|21,21 per|18,18 per


What 's notable in this debate , however , is that according to MSN Moneycentral , tobacco executives are attacking the tax by noting that " While North Carolina 's excise tax is only 5 cents , the total taxes given to North Carolina by smokers adds up to more than 61 cents per pack . "
13,14 org|17,17 per|27,28 gpe|42,43 gpe|45,45 per


Okay , okay -- since the tobacco companies pay lots of money to the states , that 's technically accurate .
14,14 gpe|7,7 org


But the point of these taxes is to align the price of a pack with the cost to society , and inasmuch as these penalties are n't assessed on a per-pack basis , they do n't -- they 're a lump-sum reflection of the taxes these companies ought to have paid before .
18,18 per|46,46 org


Interestingly , the policy of making cigarette buyers pay to compensate society for the costs they impose is a politically palatable synthesis of the unpalatable notion of simply refusing treatment unless they pay full cost .

Really not a bad lifestyle .



Anyway , back on topic here .



Market over reaction ?



Hard to say .



Both companies have pricey stocks and those valuations are based on optimistic expectations of future growth .
1,1 org


Yesterday 's news led many to question their growth assumptions for these companies .
12,12 org|4,4 per|7,7 per


Today I want to talk a bit about Starbucks .
8,8 org|1,1 per


I think I have to start by acknowledging that the stock is still pricey even after its drop yesterday .
0,0 per|2,2 per


However , my organizational indicators analysis reveals a very low level of business risk .
2,2 per


This may partially justify a higher P/E ratio .



A couple weeks ago , I observed that Wal-Mart had offsetting strong and weak organizational indicators .
8,8 org|5,5 per


Starbucks , on the other hand , has uniformly strong organizational indicators .
0,0 org


Starbucks scores as best in its industry on six of seven organizational indicators .
5,5 org|0,0 org


Not surprising are it s strong scores in the employee relations and stakeholder actions indicators .
9,9 per|12,12 per|3,3 org


It s weakest score is in the external reporting indicator .
0,0 org


In the past , several observers have raised concerns about aggressive accounting at Starbucks but my analysis does not indicate any systematic current issues .
5,5 per|13,13 org|15,15 per


The weak score is primarily the result of Starbucks current strategy of increasing equity ownership of several foreign subsidiaries .
18,18 org|8,8 org
18,18 org|8,8 org| part-whole

This is a strategic shift that has short-term costs and adds some uncertainty to the financial statements .



Beyond the strong Organizational Indicator analysis , several additional factors favor Starbucks ability to continue to grow revenues .
11,11 org


1 .



Starbucks has little debt .
0,0 org


Starbucks is not currently financing it s growth with debt .
0,0 org|5,5 org


Considering it s growth , this is amazing .
1,1 org


It also means that Starbucks has a large amount of flexibility in how it finances future growth .
4,4 org|13,13 org


The company can assume much more debt without negatively affecting it s risk profile because ...
1,1 org|10,10 org


2 .



Starbucks has a healthy cashflow and current cash position .
0,0 org


This allows the company to grow without debt .
3,3 org


You could argue that Starbucks has too much cash and should do more to pass it on to shareholders .
0,0 per|18,18 per|4,4 org


This option is another way that Starbucks has retained it s flexibility for the future .
6,6 org|9,9 org


3 .



Starbucks is the primary owner of it s stores and limits franchising .
0,0 org|4,4 org|6,6 org|8,8 fac
6,6 org|8,8 fac| art

While Starbucks does partner ( airlines , airports , Barnes &amp; Noble ) , most of it s stores are company owned .

16,16 org|18,18 fac| art

From a managerial perspective this greatly simplifies cost structures , product changes , and quality control .



Taken together all of these factors paint a picture of a company with a very strong future .
11,11 org


I can not say if these factors justify the current share price but I would say that they justify a higher P/E ratio than the industry norm .
0,0 per|13,13 per


Risk is lower .



Interesting aside : Starbucks is taking over the location in my town that was recently abandoned by Krispy Kreme .

Interestingly enough , this morning 's Wall Street Journal reported that Marsh paid a higher fee than they needed to -- that the $ 850 million number was agreed upon at the last minute mainly so Marsh could pay out over a four-year period without admitting guilt .
11,11 org|17,17 org|36,36 org|6,8 org


The rhetoric we 're hearing -- that Marsh may have cost customers billions of dollars -- does n't match the reality that in a few cases , they manipulated bids , but that the proven damages thus far involve only a few million dollars of business priced 5 % or 10 % higher than it otherwise would have been .
