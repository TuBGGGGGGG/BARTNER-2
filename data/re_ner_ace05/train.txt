Tehran had been governed by reformists since 1989 , but a conservative city council was elected in the February 28 municipal polls in a result attributed to a meager turnout amid growing public disillusionment with electoral politics .

Iraqis Mistakenly Believe Soldiers Have Sights on Sacred Landmark



MILES O'BRIEN , CNN CORRESPONDENT

Thanks very much , Judy .

And Colonel Leonhard , we 're going to talk a little bit about urban combat .
4,4 per|2,2 per|1,1 per


And I wanted to just start this off by saying a lot of people when they hear about urban combat , they think of that Blackhawk down scenario , Mogadishu and the problems that can go wrong here .
29,29 gpe|1,1 per|13,13 per|15,15 per|21,21 per


This is not probably a comparable situation , is it ?



LT. COL. ROBERT LEONHARD , U.S. ARMY ( RET . )
0,10 per


Not in any way .



And one of the reasons is because we have armored fighting vehicles there in Baghdad , and we will use them .

The Bradleys have 25-millimetre chain guns and coaxial machine guns .

That 's a lot of mobile protective gunfire .



Completely different from the Mogadishu situation in which we did not have such vehicles .

If we move in on Baghdad , and give you a sense of the kinds of targets that might be encountered in urban combat .

What we 've depicted here is something here which shows some armor sort of off the wings here , right over here is a mosque .

We depict that to show that 's something you obviously want to stay clear as we just saw with the Ryan Chilcote piece from Najaf .
20,21 per|24,24 gpe|15,15 per|0,0 org|8,8 org


As we get a little bit closer here , in a typical scenario like this , you might very well have Republican Guard snipers up on balconies like this , and possibly up on the roofs of buildings and anti-aircraft artillery or artillery encampments like that .

I think the animation is good because it does show that you can hide literally anywhere in a city environment , and that is why movement through an urban area is very , very dangerous .

It 's the side that 's moving that 's going to take the casualties .

And then we 'll probably surge fires into their both lethal and nonlethal to make his position untenable , to make him move rather than us moving through the assault zone .

Well , typically , if they do go in , which is generally the option of last resort , but if we do have to go in , often we 'll try to go in from the top of the building down .

`` The vote is desirable .

Governor Mark Warner has turned state government upside-down in an effort to do more business with small , women , and minority owned ( SWAM ) firms and the thanks he gets are headlines like this one in the Daily Press : Warner 's plan to raise contracting diversity falls short .

The article is full of innuendo that procurement officals are ignoring the Governor 's wishes and just waiting for him to leave office , that " special deals " are cut with non - SWAM vendors , and that somehow the electronic procurement system is " stacked " against SWAM firms .
49,49 org|50,50 org|34,34 org|12,12 per|19,19 per|8,8 per|35,35 org


If true , these are serious charges , worthy of high-level investigation .



What 's missing from the article , though , is any attempt at investigative journalism to give even one factual example supporting the innuendo .



What 's also missing is a fair-minded review of whether the sagging numbers reported for SWAM procurement are valid .
15,15 org


Someday a journalist is going to take the time to watch a sample number of SWAM firms submit bids on openly posted contracts , then use procurement tools that are in place to determine if any SWAM firms were unfairly denied contracts they deserved .
15,15 org|36,36 org|2,2 per|16,16 org|42,42 org|37,37 org


Until then , this carping appears to be sour grapes .



Governor Warner has done plenty to open up the system to SWAM firms and give them a presumptive advantage , even inviting a backlash by non - SWAM firms .

But inspectors also questioned Iraq 's motivation , as it began to give the inspectors what they wanted only when the threat of war became immediate .

Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how , three months before the genocide , Major General Romeo Dallaire , the commander of several thousand U.N . troops in Rwanda , sent a fax to Kofi Annan 's office , saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned .

In a study published in the Journal of Business Finance &amp; Accounting ( 2003 , 30:771 -798 ) , Greg Filbeck and Dianna Preece found that companies on the Fortune list of 100 Best Companies to Work For outperformed a matched sample of firms along multiple measures of return .

To often these studies use as a starting point the moment before information becomes public .



The only way to benefit from such information is by holding the stock before the information becomes public .



This study indicates that the Best Companies to Work For information may still be useful even after the information becomes public .

It might also be useful to look at companies that have consistently made the list in the previous few years and make an educated guess about their inclusion on this year 's list .

As rising instability in Lebanon increases tensions in the Middle East , the Bush administration is arguing with European governments over whether they should designate the Lebanon - based Shiite group Hezbollah a terrorist organization , American and European officials say .

In the past two weeks , the officials said , France has rebuffed appeals by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the Israeli foreign minister , Silvan Shalom , to list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization , which would prevent it from raising money in Europe through charity groups .

The United States has long called Hezbollah a terrorist organization , but the French , American and European officials said , have opposed doing so , and argue that making such a designation now would be unwise , given the new turbulence in Lebanon .

Israeli and American officials say that the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , has told them that he , too , regards Hezbollah as a destructive force in the Middle East , one determined to undermine peace talks by supporting militant groups that attack Israelis .

Merck posted a 21 % decline in earnings thanks to the new post-Vioxx announcement .

Most of the profit decline was because Vioxx , representing about 11 % of sales , now represents a pretty severe legal headache : Not only have they lost the revenue , but they 've taken a $ 600 million charge as a reserve against future Vioxx losses .

If that 's an accurate number , investors should cheer up : Merck 's at fifteen times annualized earnings , twelve times forward earnings , and underappreciated by most of Wall Street .

depending on the water temperature , it 's very possible that or very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time .

the nasa and the european space agency both launch missions to mars this month sending rovers and ashters to probe the red planet .

one of the big questions about mars is when or whether humans will ever be able to visit .
6,6 loc|11,11 per
11,11 per|6,6 loc| phys

it 's an idea plagued with unsolved problems .



the latest issue of " popular science magazine " takes a look at the challenges nasa is facing .
15,15 org


joining us is the contributing editor .
1,1 per|5,5 per


good to see you , jeff .
3,3 per|5,5 per


thank you .
1,1 per


it was only about 30 years ago when we went to the moon .
12,12 loc|8,8 per


so what 's the difficulty in being able to go to mars ?
11,11 loc


it 's unimaginably difficult and different .



mars is at most times 100 million miles away from us .
10,10 loc|0,0 loc


it 's a nine-month trip .



then if we stay there for about a year or two , the whole trip could last about three years .
2,2 per|4,4 loc
2,2 per|4,4 loc| phys

we 're talking about conditions where there 's radiation in space cosmic radiation that could cause cancer .
0,0 per|10,10 loc


the communications conditions once you 're on mars , just to talk to people on earth , there 's a 20 minute delay in the conversation .
15,15 loc|4,4 per|13,13 per|7,7 loc
4,4 per|7,7 loc| phys|13,13 per|15,15 loc| phys

so the -- you know , the issues are so much larger than going to the moon .
16,16 loc|3,3 per


and for now , it 's 250 days , which seems to be the maximum for astronauts in space anyway .
16,16 per|18,18 loc
16,16 per|18,18 loc| phys

but as you say , it 's a much further travel .
2,2 per


but let ' s talk about some of the hurdles that hamper humans to be able to survive there .
3,3 per|18,18 loc|12,12 per


the dust , for one thing .



cataracts another .



let ' s talk about the right kind of spacecraft that would be able to allow humans to actually get that far and to survive .
9,9 veh|10,10 veh|2,2 per|16,16 per


right .



well , first of all , the spacecraft would not be launched from earth .
13,13 loc|7,7 veh


you 'd have to launch is from in space already , which means we would have to build it in space .
13,13 per|0,0 per|5,5 veh|18,18 veh|8,8 loc|20,20 loc
13,13 per|20,20 loc| phys

so that means we need a good shuttle that 's going to take us back and forth to build the spacecraft .
3,3 per|13,13 per|20,20 veh|7,7 veh|8,8 veh
3,3 per|7,7 veh| art

then we have to come up with the fuel that will take it out of the earth 's orbit all the way to mars .
16,16 loc|1,1 per|12,12 veh|23,23 loc


that 's probably going to be nuclear propulsion at this point again something we have n't really developed yet , because we could n't carry that much fuel , obviously .
13,13 per|21,21 per


liquid oxygen would be way too heavy to carry all the way to mars .
13,13 loc


the bigger issue is once we get there , we ca n't carry oxygen or water or food to stay there three years , so we 're going to have to do all of that on the surface of the planet .
5,5 per|9,9 per|25,25 per|37,37 loc|7,7 loc|20,20 loc|40,40 loc
5,5 per|7,7 loc| phys|25,25 per|37,37 loc| phys|37,37 loc|40,40 loc| part-whole

and think of it .



mars is carbon dioxide .
0,0 loc


so we ca n't breathe there .
1,1 per|5,5 loc


so we 're going to have to come up with some conversion technique to create water , to create oxygen and then some way of growing food on the planet itself .
1,1 per|29,29 loc|30,30 loc


all of this is in the works now , but i think it 's going to take quite a few years to develop it .
10,10 per


you talk about the cosmic radiation .
0,0 per


then of course there is the zero g bone loss , almost like the eroding of bone to humans that would be at risk as well .
18,18 per


absolutely .



there could be as much as 50 % bone loss in astronauts in mars .
11,11 per|13,13 loc
11,11 per|13,13 loc| phys

why ?



during the time in mars .
4,4 loc


because when the body has -- when there is no dpravity as there is on mars , the body does n't pick up the calcium in the bones , so it does n't keep getting the bones stronger and stronger .
3,3 per|30,30 per|18,18 per|15,15 loc


so they will just lose it .
1,1 per


they will be almost like old people even at the age of 40 .

Absolutely not .



This case tells us two things : that concealed weapons permit holders respond faster than police because we are in greater numbers , and that criminals wear body armor too - so it 's ridiculous to claim that we should outlaw guns that are " too powerful " for civilian use .

It 's Auburn - Georgia week , ladies and gentlemen .

After all the smack talk that 's gone on for the last 360 days , and all of the games that both teams have played and the hopes each had for the 2004 season , it 's come down to this .
22,22 org|28,28 org


To stay undefeated and alive for a chance at the BCS title game , Auburn must win this Saturday in it 's 3:30 EST game on CBS against the Georgia Bulldogs .
20,21 org|14,14 org|29,30 org|10,10 org|26,26 org


If they hope to move up from their current number five ranking and keep the hope alive of playing in the SEC Title Game in December , Georgia must beat Auburn .
30,30 org|21,21 org|7,7 org|1,1 org|27,27 org


This game is as good as it gets .



Sure , Auburn 's in-state rival is Alabama , but year in and year out , this game , the Auburn - UGA game , seems like the one that matters more .
20,20 org|2,2 org|22,22 org|7,7 org|5,5 org


I seldom if ever root for Bama , but I always root for UGA to be undefeated when the play Auburn .
20,20 org|13,13 org|18,18 org|6,6 org|9,9 per|0,0 per


The game is big enough already , but it seems even bigger when one or both teams have something on the line .
16,16 org


Yes , both teams have other games left to play and yes , other teams ' results may affect what happens to both of these teams , but in just five days , these two teams will play the biggest and most important game of their season .
3,3 org|25,25 org|35,35 org|45,45 org|14,14 org


So now it 's time for all of the yapping and jawing and talking shit that goes with this game .

The " Twin Deficits " Myth



Byrne
0,0 per


2005-02-04T13 :37:00



According to the usually reliable CNN / Money , the " Twin Deficits " will continue to grow .
5,5 org


Interesting terminology ... I believe they 're referring to the budget deficit and ... the capital surplus ?
5,5 org|3,3 per


When analyzing trade deficits , it 's important to realize that the amount by which imports exceed exports is also equal to the net amount foreign investors have bet on the US .
31,31 gpe|26,26 per


So the trade deficit is due to a confluence of the pressures from US consumers ( who control about 20 % of global GDP ) and everybody else ( excluding the non-consumption share of US GDP , that would amount to around 75 % of global GDP ) .
13,13 gpe|34,34 gpe|14,14 per|16,16 per|26,26 per
14,14 per|13,13 gpe| gen-aff

Which of those is -- probably -- going to be a more important number ?



Even if we are consumers bent on gorging ourselves with imported goods , the largest pressure on the deficit is that we 're simply a better place for investment -- higher returns on capital in developing countries are more than mitigated by the higher political risks they face .
8,8 gpe|26,26 gpe|21,21 gpe|2,2 gpe|4,4 gpe|36,36 gpe|46,46 gpe


And what about that other deficit ?



It , of course , is the ominous sum that we fund without taxes , but by borrowing funds .
10,10 gpe


And about half of those borrowings end up with the major banks in Asia .
11,11 org|13,13 gpe
11,11 org|13,13 gpe| gen-aff

So , not to be a heretic , but 1 ) We 're issuing them at relatively low interest rates , 2 ) Inflation is bound to pick up eventually , and so 3 ) Would n't you rather have our deficits made up by economically nonsensical purchases by non - US investors , rather than raising taxes in America ?
11,11 gpe|40,40 gpe|51,51 gpe|59,59 gpe|52,52 per|37,37 per
52,52 per|51,51 gpe| gen-aff

It 's a question of who will pay for the same spending , and all else being equal I 'd be happy for Asian central banks to pick up the tab .
25,25 org|23,23 gpe|5,5 per|18,18 per
25,25 org|23,23 gpe| gen-aff

The Twin Deficits are a reality , but they are n't exactly a terrifying one .

Well , it 's mid-morning on the East coast and I am sitting here running numbers thru my head trying to figure out what 's going to happen in the Iron Bowl , which is just over 29 hours away .

The game is being played in Tuscaloosa , which should be an advantage to Alabama .

However , In the two times the game has been played in Bryant Denny Stadium , Auburn has won .

The fact that they 've won six games is a testament to the coaching and heart of the players .

Alabama simply can not throw the football , which is a good thing , because Auburn 's defensive backfield is second to none .

Bama can run the ball however .

Unfortunately for them , with no passing game to keep the defense honest , Auburn will probably stack nine in the box , play man on the corners , and dare Bama to run , and I do n't think they 'll be able to do it .

Auburn is also 9-0 when they score first .

In this exact game 15 years ago , Bama came into Auburn # 2 in the country , undefeated at 10-0 and looking for yet another national championship .
8,8 org|11,11 gpe|16,16 gpe


They were summarily trounced 30-20 in a game in which the score was closer than the actual game .

That could very well happen Saturday .



I always tell people that the Georgia game matters more to me than the Bama game .
3,3 per|6,6 org|14,14 org|0,0 per|11,11 per


I live in Georgia , and losing that game affects me much more directly than losing the Alabama game .

That said , when kickoff time comes , you remember all the reasons that you hate Alabama and their dumbass haircuts and their detergent and toilet paper and their houndstooth hats and their " Bear this " and " Bear that , " and everything else that goes along with it .
8,8 per|14,14 per|16,16 org|18,18 org|22,22 org|28,28 org|32,32 org


This is n't a football game , and it 's not two drunken cousins fighting at a family reunion .

It 's THAT serious .



However , when it 's all said and done , I just do n't think Alabama has the horses to stand up to what I believe is going to be enormous defensive pressure .
15,15 org|10,10 per|24,24 per


If Auburn takes care of the ball and executes , this game should n't be as close as some think .

More than a few e-mails have come in wondering why I have n't remarked on the horrible hunting tragedy on Nov. 21 that left six people dead , and why I have n't updated the ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN COUNTER .
10,10 per|30,30 per|36,36 wea|25,25 per


I did n't mean to wait this long and never intended to ignore the issue , but I have been extremely busy last week with Thanksgiving and everything that goes along with it .
0,0 per|17,17 per


This is problem that needs to be addressed .



But as for the assault weapons ban issue , the man accused of the brutal killings , Chai Vang of St. Paul , Minn , used a Russian - built Saiga 7.62 mm , SKS semiautomatic rifle .

As this article points out , the SKS was n't included on the list of banned weapons as part of the 10-year ban on certain " assault weapons " signed by President Clinton .
7,7 wea|32,32 per|31,31 per|16,16 wea|27,27 wea


The ban expired in September and at the time of this posting , no one has been killed by any one of those weapons since the ban expired .
14,14 per|20,20 wea|23,23 wea


But let ' s talk about this case , as I 'm sure discussions have started and many want stronger gun control because of this freak incident .
17,17 per|20,20 wea|10,10 per|3,3 per


While the media use words like " military style , " " assault " and " semiautomatic , " the gun used in the slayings was not unlike a typical hunting rifle .
2,2 org|7,7 org|31,31 wea|20,20 wea


The SKS is a medium-powered carbine equipped with a 10 - round magazine , just like the pistol I 'm displaying in the photo on the left hand side of this blog .
1,1 wea|5,5 wea|17,17 wea|11,11 wea|18,18 per


Banned weapons had capacities of more than 10 rounds ; so like my small 9mm , the SKS was not classified as an " assault " weapon .
17,17 wea|14,14 wea|8,8 wea|12,12 per|1,1 wea|26,26 wea


So let ' s not center our discussion around the gun , let ' s talk about the person behind the trigger .
18,18 per|10,10 wea|14,14 per|3,3 per|6,6 per

If convicted of the killings , Vang faces life in prison as Minnesota does not honor the death penalty .

At first , I was pretty skeptical of Gmail -- an announcement of something new , cool , and free , from a quirky company , on April Fool 's Day ?

Turns out my initial attitude was n't justified , of course , and Gmail has been a popular success .

Just this weekend , Google gave many users another fifty invitations , prompting some to speculate that it could be the start of Gmail 's final move out of beta .
4,4 org|7,7 per|13,13 per


Their marketing was absolutely brilliant : Simply through association with Google , and because of the invitation-only membership , they created a product with instant cachet -- something so in demand invitations went for $ 50 on eBay , and one enterprising site even offered a kidney for an invite .
37,37 org|19,19 org|0,0 org|10,10 org


And now ?



Everyone who wants a Gmail account has one , and yet people with invites have an almost pathological desire to give them away .

Socially responsible investing .



Corporate social responsibility .



Just saying these words seems to elicit some fairly simplistic knee-jerk reactions .



The reaction that I find most amusing is the knowing look of sympathy .
3,3 per


You know , the one that says " Poor naive soul .
10,10 per|0,0 per


If only you understood economics , you would understand the folly of your ways . "
2,2 per|6,6 per|12,12 per


I do not intend to get into the stakeholder vs stockholder debate here or argue the relative merits of Atlas Shrugged .
0,0 per|8,8 per|10,10 per


Those discussions , though interesting , avoid a simpler question .



Do measures of corporate social responsibility contain valuable added information that help investors pick winning investments ?
12,12 per


If all that you have read about this topic is an article in Business Week or The Wall Street Journal , you 've probably heard the standard answer -- the evidence is mixed .
13,14 org|17,19 org|3,3 per|21,21 per


That is true but not very revealing would n't you say ?
9,9 per


Evidence is mixed mostly because ( 1 ) there is little agreement about how to measure social responsibility and ( 2 ) many current measures toss together a heap of information that has no business being lumped together .
34,34 org


Social responsibility often includes everything from treatment of employees to type of product produced .
8,8 per


There is not really any reason to believe that selling guns or tobacco has anything to do with forcing employees to work unpaid overtime .
19,19 per|10,10 wea


Yet both get lumped together in the socially responsible investing discussion .



Once you start to break apart social responsibility into its various components , you start to see the valuable information .
1,1 per|13,13 per


Companies that have poor employee relations tend to underperform , as do companies that pollute at a higher rate than their industry peers .
22,22 org|4,4 per|13,13 org|12,12 org|20,20 org|0,0 org

On the other hand , companies with numerous NLRB violations do n't do worse than their peers and companies that sell your typical " sin " products ( tobacco , firearms , gambling ) can be excellent investments .

Lump all these things together and of course you will get mixed results .

Taken separately , they provide valuable information about future firm performance .

WalMart : Conglomerating ?



Byrne

2004-12-12T14 :47:00



Conglomerates are a fascinating species : The standard definition is ' a company involved in multiple unrelated businesses ' but the more accurate definition would be ' a company that relies on financial pyrotechnics , balance sheet juggling , and adroit accounting to create the illusion of growth ' .
0,0 org|12,12 org|28,28 org|29,29 org|4,4 org


I love to write about them , but I 'd hate to own one , since most of their market value comes from the market 's assumption that the company 's leaders will somehow find a way to retroactively justify their overvaluation .

Usually , it does n't work , but when it does the results can be spectacularly entertaining .



For a while ( see Ling-Temco-Vought or Tyco for details ) .
5,5 org|7,7 org


The recent rumors about WalMart 's plans to buy out a shipping company have given rise to the fear that the company may go the conglomerate route .
4,4 org|21,21 org|25,25 org|12,12 org
12,12 org|4,4 org| part-whole

They have many of the symptoms of a late-stage conglomerate : A gigantic main business with slowing growth , fear that competition will substantially reduce the profitability of their main business , a shareholder base that includes many people who own only WalMart stock ( thus providing another incentive for intracompany diversification ) , and enough resources to pull it off on a grand scale .

39,39 per|42,42 org| org-aff

I can understand the concerns , but I do n't see the motivation .
0,0 per|7,7 per


As a retailer of just about everything , WalMart can expand into some pretty broadly-defined areas without going beyond either their core competencies or some arenas where they can cut costs .
2,2 org|8,8 org|20,20 org|27,27 org


After all , adding some international shipping assets to their holdings would be a natural extension of their enormously successful practice of buying the distribution network for their products .
9,9 org|17,17 org|27,27 org


They 're coming close to Smithfield Food 's very successful ' squeal to meal ' policy ; if these rumors are true , the result for shareholders will be a pretty positive one .

What form we may find them and what traces of destruction and all the rest of it will be very interesting and , likewise , the intellectual capital that is there to produce more .

Because not much else is -- you do n't need much to get it going again .

And that , I think , we have to be working with these people who are in the business to make sure they do n't re-enter the business , much as we did with Russian scientists under the Nunn - Lugar program .

There 's no doubt about that at all , both in Iran and against the Kurdish population .

Well , it 's important .



But I do n't think it 's as important as finding Osama bin Laden , for the simple reason that I do n't think Saddam Hussein today poses any threat , wherever he is .
1,1 per|20,20 per|24,25 per|32,32 per|11,13 per

Video Rentals : The Three Hypotheses

2004-12-11T18 :45:00



Scrappy underdog Netflix had its day earlier in the year , when it became one of the hottest stocks around ( sporting an eye-popping P/E in the high 900 's on the way up , and , thanks to a poor earnings report , over 1,000 on the way down ) .
2,2 org|1,1 org|4,4 org|12,12 org


There 's plenty of argument about the future of DVD and video rental , and Netflix represents a pure-play on one of the three dominant hypotheses :
15,15 org


I .



That business is O-V-E-R -- Between pay-per-view , video-on-demand , pirated movies , high-bandwidth Internet broadcasts , and the increasing availability of other media , it takes some faith to see any future for movie rentals .
1,1 org


Those who do n't have the requisite faith will point to these factors as proof that the business is dying and the movie business in general will need a pretty significant overhaul before it can make profits .
0,0 per|1,1 per|17,17 org|23,23 org|33,33 org


Movie rentals are no longer a cheap alternative to other ways of viewing films ; they 're the stodgy , expensive way .



There are n't any pure-play buys on this theory , but someone who believes it might overweight their portfolio in cable companies -- if they purchased any media stocks at all .
11,11 per|12,12 per|24,24 per|17,17 per|21,21 org
12,12 per|21,21 org| org-aff

Of course , there have been companies whose performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea , but Psuedo.com failed without producing a single show , and Broadcast.com was swallowed for $ 6 billion by Yahoo !
6,6 org|7,7 org|19,19 org|28,28 org|36,36 org


, to Yahoo !
2,2 org


's great regret .



II .



Not so fast -- it 'll just go online !



-- Anyone who wants to counter that argument would probably start by taking us back to 1997 , when in terms of time used , text was the most popular kind of information online .
1,1 per|2,2 per|13,13 per


At the time , and for years after , people argued that the traditional bookstore would become obsolete .
14,14 fac|9,9 per


After all , how could we stand for a rapaciously arborcidal medium like ' books ' or ' newspapers ' when we could transmit the same data as bits and bytes and save on transportation , too ?
5,5 per|21,21 per


As it turns out , of course , Amazon.com , BarnseandNoble.com , and a host of others simply took the bookstore model , attached a 56K modem , and declared themselves The Future .
20,20 fac|10,10 org|8,8 org|14,14 org|30,30 org


Netflix is doing much the same thing : Taking the traditional business online to cut costs and boost customer service .
0,0 org|18,18 per


III .



Who d' you think you 're kidding ?
2,2 per|4,4 per|0,0 per


You ca n't kill movie rental stores -- So there 's a big difference between movies and books : For books , the retail store is practically the sole medium of distribution ; if you do n't sell through them , books wo n't get sold .
24,24 fac|39,39 fac|29,29 fac|0,0 per|34,34 per|6,6 org


For movies , the video rental store is just one way to get videos out there ( though at 45-55 % of studio revenues , it 's a much more important one than people think ) .
6,6 org|25,25 org|31,31 org|22,22 org


But given the high valuations ascribed to bricks-and-mortar-and-dead tree booksellers like Barnes and Noble , Borders , and to a much lesser extent Books-A-Million , surely there 's room for a Blockbuster , along with a Movie Gallery or two .
9,9 fac|11,13 org|15,15 org|23,23 org|31,31 org|36,37 org


The latter , at least , still has room to grow .
1,1 org


By focusing on smaller , rural communities ( preferably the sort that considers DSL ' newfangled ' ) they 're WalMarting WalMart -- competing with Walmart 's awful in-store video rentals by offering better selection and much lower prices .
18,18 org|21,21 org|25,25 org|6,6 gpe|28,28 fac


The movie business is changing dramatically as the potential for online distribution grows , but like every other business it leaves lots of room for traditional operators to operate at traditional ( read : high ) profits .
2,2 org|19,19 org


The aggressive bidding war for Hollywood Video , featuring two of their competitors , a buyout shop , and one of the savviest raiders around , is proof that some people still think these stores are worth something .
5,6 org|11,11 org|12,12 org|16,16 org|23,23 org|34,34 org|30,30 per


And I 'm one of them .
1,1 per|3,3 per|5,5 per


Full Disclosure : For once , I 'm actually writing about something I own : I have shares of Movie Gallery , I 've suggested it to friends , and I 'd be quite thrilled if the stock went up .

I do n't do ' sell targets ' , but I 'd probably hold the stock if it ran up anything less than 50 % from this level .
0,0 per|10,10 per


If I sell , I 'll post a notification one trading day beforehand .

Russia hints " peace camp " alliance with Germany and France is dying by Dmitry Zaks

Russian President Vladimir Putin 's summit with the leaders of Germany and France may have been a failure that proves there can be no long-term " peace camp " alliance following the end of war in Iraq , government sources were quoted as saying at the weekend . "

The comments indicate that Russia 's nuanced position over the war in Iraq was becoming ever more scrambled , with Putin pushing to protect his budding friendship with US President George W. Bush in the face of strident opposition from the Russian media and other top Kremlin officials .

I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners , which this might very well be a precursor to : Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface-to-air missiles ( SAMs ) , referred to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems ( MANPADS ) , pose to commercial airliners .

Most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mitigate this threat .

Instead , a menu of options may be considered , including installing infrared ( IR ) countermeasures on aircraft ; modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures ; improving airport and regional security ; and strengthening missile non-proliferation efforts .

Equipping aircraft with missile countermeasure systems can protect the aircraft even when operating in areas where ground-based security measures are unavailable or infeasible to implement .
3,3 wea|1,1 veh|9,9 veh|15,15 loc|14,14 loc


However , this option has a relatively high cost , between $ 1 million and $ 3 million per aircraft , and the time needed for implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing terrorist threat .
19,19 veh|36,36 per


Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training , altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat , and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks .

It 's always difficult to get used to a central fact of the modern economy : The best new technology will keep getting better at an absolutely astounding rate .



Usually , the improvement curve flattens pretty fast -- the usual auto industry / computer industry comparison works just fine ( According to the standard urban legend , Bill Gates notes that " If we 'd been making cars instead of software , you 'd get 500 miles to the gallon , need an oil change every 250,000 miles , and be able to replace your car for $ 200 , " to which a mythical GM executive replies " Ah , but if Microsoft made cars , they 'd crash three times a day , too ! " )

Anyway , a few announcements during the last two days underscore the fact that the growth in memory and processing power for computers is far from over : Hewlett-Packard is developing a new replacement for the transistor , and a consortium of software companies is backing a new technology that would allow discs to hold up to a terabyte of information .
28,28 org|40,40 org|43,43 org
