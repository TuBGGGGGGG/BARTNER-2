If I recall correctly , the last time that Virginia seriously addressed the " incentives " issue was during the Allen administration .

The idea then was to peg incentives to performance : If the touted jobs and investment do n't materialize , you lose the tax breaks and incentives .

By demanding accountability , Peterson 's bill is in the spirit of Virginia 's existing policy , thought perhaps somewhat tougher .

The same might be said of Chap 's condiment-packaged business bill .
6,6 per


Delegate Chap Petersen bill is nothing more than salt and pepper electioneering in the 2005 statewide campaign -- and is probably tied into the Democratic outsourcing clamor and growing threat of more manufacturing plants closing , which John Kerry politically contrived and sensationalized for the 04 presidential run .

But both parties are responsible and have voted in favor of those agreements .

Lt. Governor candidate 's Chap Peterson and Leslie Byrne are both good politicians , but need to start thinking outside the box with legislation that will attract and benefit economic growth for the business world and create sustainable workplaces for Virginians .

Will , I agree with your analysis , the VA business community along with a majority of GA members will probably deep-six this 5-year mandatory requirement for compensation due to relocation .

If not bordering on the political ridorkulous ( ridiculously dorky ) , it 's just plain ludicrous to believe business owners would agree to a capital investment with strings attached to the businesses health and longevity .
20,20 per


Reward-to-punishment-to-reward maybe good dog training techniques , but it 's not very business friendly .



The Commonwealth needs legislation that requires a mandatory Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ) within the contractual economic development agreements .
1,1 gpe


The ESOP is itself a corporate finance vehicle that provides monetary incentives with lending institutes , state and federal tax benefits , new capital investment , and most of all , the stock ownership plan increases VA employee capital wealth .

More capital wealth will drive our consumer - base economy through the flipping roof .

But most importantly , how many Virginia businesses will choose to relocate -- or outsource when employee are the corporate stockowners ?

And let s say the business has no other choice but to remove to the third world ...

all together these tax reductions will help 92 million americans .
9,9 per


and a significant part of the benefit to our economy will come within the first two years of the plan .
8,8 gpe


a family of four with an income of $ 40,000 would receive a 96 % reduction in federal income taxes .
1,1 per|3,3 per
1,1 per|3,3 per| per-soc

instead of paying $ 1,178 per year , the family would pay $ 45 a year .
9,9 per


[ applause ] that means extra money in the family budget year after year .
9,9 per


that money can cover a lot of bills .



that money can help families with purchases they have been delaying .
4,4 per|7,7 per


that money will be in circulation , which will be good for our economy .
12,12 gpe


[ applause ] and this plan will help our small business sector .
8,8 gpe|11,11 org|10,10 org


the benefits of the growth plan will come from uncreased consumer spending and , as importantly , from a lower income tax rates on the small businesses themselves .
27,27 org|26,26 org|10,10 per


it is important for our fellow citizens to understand that most small businesses pay their business taxes at the individual rates .
12,12 org|14,14 org|19,19 per|6,6 gpe|4,4 gpe|15,15 org


most small businesses are sole proprietorships , limited partnerships , are subchapter ss , and , therefore , when you reduce individual tax rates , you benefit small business formation .
2,2 org|5,5 org|8,8 org|12,12 org|19,19 per|25,25 per|28,28 org


as a matter of fact , under this plan , some 23 million small business owners will see their taxes cut .
15,15 per|18,18 per|14,14 org
15,15 per|14,14 org| org-aff

which leaves more money for investment , more money for growth , more money for job creation .



a growing economy also needs small business investment .
6,6 org


and our tax code should encourage investment .
1,1 gpe


today a small business can deduct a maximum of $ 25,000 in the year in which they buy equipment .
3,3 org|16,16 org


we need to triple the amount that can be deducted in the year in which they buy equipment .

[ applause ] so i propose to congress that they ought to limit -- limit ought to be increased to $ 75,000 and that limit ought to be indexed to inflation .

by doing so , we promote greater investment in machinery .

and when a small business bias machine that enhances their company 's product divty as well as it means machinery manufacturer is likely to have more work available .
20,20 org|4,4 org|10,10 org|9,9 org


more investment equals jobs .



and what we are interested in in this administration is helping people who look for work find a job .
8,8 org|2,2 org|11,11 per|12,12 per


[ applause ] we can also promote economic growth and job creation by removing the double tax on dividends .
3,3 org


[ applause ] taxing corporate income once is fair .



it is not fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice .
7,7 gpe


the burden of double taxation falls on the millions of individuals who receive dividends .
10,10 per|11,11 per


falls especially hard on seniors who receive half of all dividend income .

removal of double taxation would put more money in the hands of investors .

the pro growth package was urgent in january .



it 's even more urgent today .



[ applause ] it is important for you all to understand and for our fellow americans to understand the tax relief that i have proposed and will push for until enacted would create -- [ applause ] will create 1.4 million new jobs by the end of 2004 .

in two years time , this nation has experienced war , a recession and a national emergency .

which has caused our government to run a deficit .

the best way to reduce the deficit is with more growth in our economy , which means more revenues to our treasury , and less spending in washington , d.c .
12,12 gpe|20,20 gpe|27,29 gpe


[ applause ] i am pleased that both the house and senate have passed budget resolutions that show real spending restraint .
3,3 per|7,7 org|9,9 org|11,11 org


and now the congress must focus on a robust and effective growth package .

we need at least $ 550 billion in that package because the more tax relief that goes to the american people , the more jobs we will create in this economy .

MCI to pay huge fine to SEC for accounting fraud : report



WASHINGTON , May 19 ( AFP )
0,0 gpe|5,5 org


MCI , formerly WorldCom , and the Securities and Exchange Commission have reached a final agreement in the telecom giant 's 11-billion-dollar ( 9.4-billion-euro ) fraud case , The Wall Street Journal reported Monday .
0,0 org|3,3 org|19,19 org|7,10 org|29,31 org


Under terms of the agreement , to be submitted as early as Monday to a judge presiding over the case , MCI would agree to pay the largest fine imposed so far by the SEC on a company that is not a broker - dealer , the Journal said , citing sources close to the matter .

The report did not give the amount of the fine , but said it would be " exponentially larger " than the historic 10 million dollars Xerox paid the SEC last year .

Last month , the SEC slapped fines totaling 1.4 billion dollars on 10 Wall Street brokerages to settle charges of conflicts of interest between analysts and investors .

MCI and the SEC negotiated the agreement for months after a partial settlement in November under which MCI , formerly known as WorldCom , agreed not to mislead investors about its finances , and to improve internal controls , the Journal said .

The estimated value of the fraud has reached historic proportions , swelling from the initially announced 3.5 million dollars to 11 million dollars as revelations of misconduct piled on , the report said .



Separately , former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers failed on April 29 to make a first repayment of 25 million dollars , plus interest , on a 400-million-dollar loan from MCI , the Journal said , citing SEC documents .

These insider sales were certainly stupid , and probably criminal ( though the legal proof may be hard to come by ) but the solution is easy enough : They need to buy stock from the company itself , at some premium to the prices at which they sold -- they 'll have the same stake as before , the shareholders would have gotten their money back ( since the premium goes to the company , which is owned by the shareholders ) , and there 's no need to disrupt their business by taking the matter to court .

During their first war summit on March 27 at Camp David , Blair and Bush became divided over what a role the United Nations will play in postwar Iraq , when Bush gave no positive reaction to Blair 's suggestion of a strong UN role .

South Korea 's ruling party is facing an internal reformist call for dissolving itself to create a new group after a humiliating defeat at last week 's by-elections , party officials said Tuesday .

The ruling Millennium Democratic Party ( MDP ) , founded by former president Kim Dae-Jung , has suffered declining popularity since President Roh Moo-Hyun took office in February .

A group of 18 reformist MDP lawmakers , mostly Roh 's confidants , demanded late Wednesday that the party be " constructively dissolved " to create a new grouping , MDP officials said .

Shame on the NHL and shame on the players ' association for not getting a deal done , but I put much more of the blame on the owners as this " negotiation " came down to the wire .

The first thing that needs to happen is that Bettman and Goodenow ( the players ' association rep ) need to be fired , deported , flogged , tarred and feathered and finally forced to pay for four tickets plus a program , four dogs , four beers , and two cokes and parking to a game at an NHL arena for every day of the next season so they understand what the fans go thru to see a hockey game .

Then , all current contracts need to be voided by the end of the season in 2006 .



That means no team would own any player , and the owners would be free to sign whomever they 'd like using the " fiscal restraint " they all droned on and on about all year .

Very few people give one hot shit whether the NHL plays another game ever , let alone this season or the next one .

Europe Changing Their Tune ?

American Future has a link up to a article written in yesterdays Houston Chronicle .
12,13 org


It describes how the European Governments look to be changing their tune in regards to President Bush .
4,4 gpe|5,5 org|10,10 org|16,16 per|15,15 per
5,5 org|4,4 gpe| part-whole

Why you ask ?
1,1 per


But there is arguably more to this sea change than just a grumpy acceptance of the status quo .



From a European perspective , three things are making it easier to warm to the Bush White House .
2,2 gpe|15,15 per|16,17 org
15,15 per|16,17 org| org-aff

One is the death of Yasser Arafat .
5,6 per


No issue divides Europe and the United States more keenly than the Israeli - Palestinian dispute .
14,14 gpe|6,7 gpe|3,3 gpe|12,12 gpe


For the last few years , Europeans have criticized Bush for failing to put enough pressure on Israel to get out of the occupied territories and for refusing to deal with Arafat .
31,31 per|6,6 gpe|9,9 per|24,24 loc|17,17 gpe


That another reason why I respect Bush so much , his refusal to acknowledge that windbag terrorist Arafat .
16,16 per|17,17 per|4,4 per|10,10 per|6,6 per


May he rot in hell .
1,1 per|4,4 loc
1,1 per|4,4 loc| phys

But since Arafat 's death , Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground : supporting Ariel Sharon 's withdrawal from Gaza , putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and , covertly , backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader .
2,2 per|18,19 per|23,23 loc|40,41 per|47,47 per|32,32 gpe|46,46 gpe|8,8 gpe|6,6 gpe|28,28 gpe
47,47 per|46,46 gpe| org-aff

A second reason is Europe 's growing worries about Islamic terrorism .
4,4 gpe|9,9 per


The murder in November of Theo van Gogh , a provocative Dutch filmmaker , at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe 's 9/11 .
24,24 gpe|5,7 per|12,12 per|11,11 gpe|20,20 per|19,19 per
12,12 per|11,11 gpe| gen-aff|20,20 per|19,19 per| gen-aff

Though the two events are obviously not fully comparable , it is certainly true that American conservatives , such as Francis Fukuyama and Bernard Lewis , have found a wider audience recently for the idea that radical Islam is inimical to European traditions of tolerance .
15,15 gpe|41,41 gpe|16,16 per|20,21 per|23,24 per|30,30 per
16,16 per|15,15 gpe| gen-aff|16,16 per|20,21 per| gen-aff|16,16 per|23,24 per| gen-aff

You mean those radical muslims can be kinda nasty sometimes ?
0,0 per|4,4 per


Get outta here .... Keep doing business like the cowards in Spain and they will more then likely have their very own 9/11 to cry about .
13,13 gpe|19,19 gpe|21,21 gpe|9,9 per|11,11 gpe
9,9 per|11,11 gpe| phys

The third force is the reappearance , albeit in a milder form , of the threat that kept the trans - Atlantic alliance together for half a century .
22,22 gpe|21,21 loc


The Russian bear is growling again .
1,1 gpe|2,2 gpe


The Ukrainian election --- complete with its KGB - style poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy-handed electoral fraud -- has reminded European diplomats of Vladimir V. Putin 's determination to control his " near abroad . "
22,22 gpe|1,1 gpe|7,7 org|14,14 per|23,23 per|25,27 per|32,32 per|35,35 loc
23,23 per|22,22 gpe| org-aff|32,32 per|35,35 loc| phys

They should be very worried about this item , I believe Putin is slowly sliding Russia back to what it once was .
15,15 gpe|19,19 gpe|0,0 per|11,11 per|9,9 per
11,11 per|15,15 gpe| org-aff

Hopefully our Government is n't asleep at the wheel with this situation either .
2,2 gpe|1,1 gpe


There is a personal edge to all this .



Just as the snooty continentals eventually came to admire the gormless Hollywood actor , there is a grudging willingness to rethink some prejudices about the inarticulate Texan .
4,4 per|12,12 per|26,26 per|11,11 org
12,12 per|11,11 org| org-aff

Many European leaders once swallowed the Michael Moore version of history : that Bush was an ignorant interloper who stole the White House .
1,1 gpe|2,2 per|6,7 per|13,13 per|17,17 per|18,18 per|21,22 org
2,2 per|1,1 gpe| org-aff

His thumping re-election , however , shows that he represents a large body of conservative American opinion .
15,15 gpe|0,0 per|8,8 per


In short , Europeans are getting used to the idea that it is not Bush who is the exception , but the U.S .
22,22 gpe|3,3 gpe|18,18 per|14,14 per|15,15 per


itself that is exceptional --- and that if they want to deal with this exceptional superpower they need to humor it rather than rile it .
0,0 gpe|15,15 gpe|20,20 gpe|24,24 gpe|8,8 gpe|16,16 gpe


Strangely enough , this has been Tony Blair 's strategy all along ; it is rapidly becoming the Continent 's strategy , too .

I wish I could have been at a Pub , or wherever these people convene , to see the reactions from all the Britons who read the Telegraph this morning ( emphasis added ) : Britain 's gun laws are aimed at the wrong target , curbing and criminalising legal ownership while failing to tackle huge rises in shooting offences over the past few years , according to an international firearms legislation expert .

Prof Gary Mauser said that Britain was making the same mistake as Canada and Australia in focusing on legal owners - a section of the law-abiding community where gun crimes , such as the Dunblane massacre , were aberrations .

Prof Mauser added : " The sad truth is that while the police officers are inspecting farmers ' gun cabinets to see if they comply with regulations somewhere in the UK , someone , who has not filled in a firearms certificate form , will be smuggling a gun into the country or selling one to an inner city youth .

The amount in question : $ 37 million .



While it 's not a major sum compared to the amounts consider before ( as high as $ 90 million ) , it 's good to see that the issue 's getting resolved .



Though , of course , there 's always the chance that these fund managers were stupid and shortsighted , not actually criminal ; apparently , the money stolen was lent to or invested in companies the managers controlled -- so they 're guilty of front-running , at the least .

Sirius Satellite -- Brilliant Plan , or Grasping at Straws ?

Mel Karmazin is pushing to add Sirius Satellite services to iPods -- an interesting idea , inasmuch as it seems to defeat the purpose of both .

The iPod 's the tiniest possible container for vast music libraries , and Sirius is a way to get at lots of content when said music library is unavailable .



On the other hand , Karmazin and Jobs are two of the smartest dealmakers around , so they might find a way to structure this or spin it to the benefit of everyone .

Alas , too little too late was the case thanks to the inept Wyatt Sexton who has been our starter since replacing Rix earlier in the season .

On Sunday we saw " Saw " ( review coming ) and as expected I was less than satisfied .

There 's news , of course ( the only time there 's no news whatsoever is when the entire market tanks ) , but missing estimates by a penny and showing some ' red flags ' should n't be an excuse for lopping off twice as much as the market had the night before ( after hours , eBay had lost a modest 10 % or so ) .

Watching a stock drop after hours , open lower , and close even lower than that makes me wonder just who 's selling : a runup usually builds on a gradual crescendo of greater-fool theory -- everyone thinks they can always sell to someone dumber -- and ends when the greatest fool yet gets sick of the whole thing and bails .

CIA SAYS NORTH KOREA HAS NEW NUCLEAR TESTING SITE AND TECHNOLOGY



WASHINGTON

U.S . intelligence officials now believe North Korea is developing the technology to make nuclear warheads small enough to fit atop the country 's growing arsenal of missideS ( potentially putting Tokyo and U.S . troops based in Japan at risk , according to officials who have received the intelligence reports .

In the assessment , which they have shared with Japan , South Korea and other allies in recent weeks , officials at the Central Intelligence Agency said that U.S . satellites have identified a sophisticated new nuclear testing site in an area called Youngdoktong .

At the site , equipment has been set up to test conventional explosives that , when detonated , could compress a plutonium core and set onfe nuclear explosion .

[ oMa intelligence officials believe that the existence of the testing range is evidence that the country intends to manufacture much more sophisticated weapons that would be light enough to put onto its growing arsenal of medium - and long-range missiles .

U.S . satellites have been watching North Korean nuclear activity intently since late last year , when the North evicted international inspectors .
